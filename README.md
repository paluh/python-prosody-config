# Parser and priter for Prosody config file

This module is work in progress. When finished it will allow you to read/modify Prosody config file.


# Installation

You have to use `pip` with `--process-dependency-links` if you want to install this library as it depends on `lua-ast` which is hosted on github (I haven't published it yet on PyPI).
